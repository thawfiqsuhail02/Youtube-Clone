# Youtube-Clone
Objective:
YouTube Clone is aiming to change the way it helps people search and discover content, in a bid to increase users and get them to stay on the site longer and create a user-friendly video player.
Problem:
YouTube is facing the same problems like content management and lack of oversight. They’re also too big to be able to delete every single harmful video and The toggling between light and dark mode is a big process.
Solution:
a mobile app that provides only limited content of videos based on user search and we can toggle between different themes based on a button placed in the header. 
Build:
This application combines API features with other functionality in the Android SDK to show off the API's capabilities. The app shows a video wall of thumbnail images for videos in a YouTube playlist. One of the thumbnails will flip over and begin playing a video from the playlist, which will play until it finishes. After that, the video will be replaced with a thumbnail, and a different thumbnail will flip over to play another video
